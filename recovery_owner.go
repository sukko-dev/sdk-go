// The recovery owner is the third supervisor-lifetime single-owner goroutine
// launched in run() (alongside the auth-owner and the subscribe serializer). It owns the recovery
// FSM (recovery.go) and is the sole sender of `replay` frames.
//
// It exists for the same reason the serializer does: recovery is stateful and
// must not race the data plane. The DECODE loop hands off — it admits gap /
// replay_complete / grant events to the inbox and pokes; the owner drains them and
// performs the FSM's replay sends. The decode loop and the supervisor's epoch
// reset are the SAME goroutine (runEpoch is the decode loop), so admitting the
// reset through this SAME inbox makes the event stream totally ordered: every
// event is processed relative to the epoch that produced it, and a reset applies
// to exactly the epoch that just died. That total order is what lets the owner
// gate each send on the current epoch with a simple pointer compare, with no
// drain-at-send race window — a deliberate departure from the serializer's
// drain-after-read discipline, which suits inputs that are NOT epoch-ordered and
// whose state self-corrects by recomputation; the recovery FSM is neither.

// recoveryEventKind tags an inbox event.
