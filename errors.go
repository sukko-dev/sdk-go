// This file holds the SDK's error surface: sentinels for conditions a caller
// branches on, typed structs for failures that carry detail, and the bridge
// that ties them together.
//
// The two are parallel mechanisms — errors.Is for "which condition is this",
// errors.As for "give me the detail" — so every struct with a corresponding
// sentinel implements Is. Without that bridge, several sentinels would be
// exported symbols nothing could ever match: ErrNotAvailable in particular is
// only ever carried as a code on a typed struct.
//
// Every message is prefixed "sukko: " so it stays attributable once it has been
// wrapped a few layers deep in a caller's own error chain.

// Sentinel errors. Match with errors.Is; several are also reachable through the
