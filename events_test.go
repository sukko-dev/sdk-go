// The Event union is a sealed set: an interface with an unexported marker
// method, so only types in this package can be members and a caller's type
// switch over it is exhaustive against a set the SDK controls.
//
// These tests pin the membership two ways — a compile-time assertion per member
// (the file would not build if a member lost its marker) and a runtime roster
// checked against the count — so that adding a member without updating the
// roster, or dropping one, fails here rather than silently changing what a
// caller's type switch must handle.

// Compile-time membership. Each line fails to build if that type stops
// implementing Event. The non-error members first:
var (
	_ Event = (*Message)(nil)

	_ Event = (*PossibleGap)(nil)

	_ Event = (*ReplayComplete)(nil)
	_ Event = (*StateChange)(nil)
	_ Event = (*Terminal)(nil)
	_ Event = (*UnknownEvent)(nil)

// implements both error and Event. `case *ReplayError:` in a type switch yields
// a value that errors.As also matches — there is no parallel wrapper hierarchy.
