// ─── gap → replay recovery FSM (Slice 2) ───

// The recovery FSM is a pure per-channel action machine — the sukko-py
// RecoveryEngine shape (§XVIII): each handle* method mutates the channel state
// and returns the replay sends the owner must perform, with no I/O of its own.
// runRecoveryOwner is the thin single-owner I/O shell around it (recovery_owner.go).
//
// Two contract facts drive the design:
//
//   - `pos` is opaque and MUST NEVER be compared. Gaps for a channel arrive in
//     connection order, so the FIRST un-recovered gap's last_pos is the anchor for
//     the whole replay cycle; later gaps within the cycle mean "more loss", covered
//     by replaying from the earlier anchor (the contract's conservative-anchor
//     guarantee: may re-deliver, never misses). Coalescing is therefore by ARRIVAL
//     ORDER, never magnitude.
//
//   - The server rejects a replay for a channel it does not have subscribed
//     (handler_replay.go: "subscribe before replaying"). So a gap whose epoch died
//     must NOT be replayed on the next epoch until that channel is re-granted there.
//     Epoch-boundary re-drive is GRANT-triggered (handleGrant), never epoch-up-
//     triggered. Every send is epoch-gated: the FSM emits a replay only for
//     the CURRENT epoch, and the owner sends it on that epoch's own bound conn.
