// The subscribe serializer is a supervisor-lifetime single-owner goroutine — the
// third such goroutine alongside the auth-owner. It exists because the wire's
// subscription_ack carries NO correlation id (research D10): with two subscribes
// in flight an arriving ack is unattributable, and the grant diff feeds both the
// not-granted event and the escalation delta, so mis-attribution would fabricate
// or discard denials. The serializer therefore keeps at most ONE subscribe/
// unsubscribe outstanding at a time; callers still call concurrently and the SDK
// does the serializing.
//
// The serializer owns the queue (subReqCh), the desired set, the wire sends, and
// the one-outstanding slot (subFlight). The DECODE loop — not the serializer —
// reconciles an arriving ack and emits *SubscriptionResult, so the grant event is
// in receive order relative to data (the same discipline auth uses for
// *Authenticated); it reads the serializer's requested set from subFlight and then
// pokes the serializer to release the slot. This keeps the control-plane rule: the
// decode loop hands off (a poke), never enqueues.
