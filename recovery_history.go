// The History single-flight (Slice 3b). History() requests up to `limit` historical
// records for a channel; they arrive as SourceHistory *Message events terminated by
// history_complete (or history_error). Only ONE history may be outstanding per
// client: N concurrent histories would put N×HistoryLimit records on the
// bounded delivery channel. That single-flight is enforced by historyFlight, a
// leaf-lock slot shared by three parties — the CALLER (claim, and identity-matched
// releaseIf on a send failure), the DECODE loop (channel-matched release on a
// terminator), and the recovery OWNER (deadline + epoch-death interrupt).
//
// History is NOT in the recovery FSM (which is per-channel replay): it is a
// client-level, single-flight, one-shot request that does NOT re-drive across a
// reconnect — an epoch death mid-history is a truncated recovery, interrupted and
// abandoned (the caller re-requests), the deliberate asymmetry with replay.
//
// LOCK DISCIPLINE (§VII): every decision — the owner's deadline check and its
// epoch-death check — reads, decides, and mutates `active` under ONE lock hold and
// returns the channel to interrupt; the owner surfaces the *RecoveryInterruptedError
// AFTER unlocking, because ownerSurface can park on back-pressure and a lock held
// across that park would block every History() caller and every decode release for
// the whole stall. Keeping each decision a single critical section is also what
// makes a generation stamp unnecessary. The lock is never held across a send.
