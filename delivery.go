// The delivery channel and its classed reserve (ADR-0006).
//
// Messages() hands the caller this raw bounded channel, so the SDK has no hook
// on receives and cannot keep a true occupancy count — only len(ch). Yet the
// channel's top AdvisoryHeadroom slots must be reserved by class, so an
// unbounded producer (a publish-rate event) can never starve a bounded safety
// producer, and the final *Terminal always has a slot. Admission is therefore a
// lock plus a reservation counter, with the channel send performed outside the
// lock; the parked-sender wake, which no channel primitive provides, is a
// clock-driven re-probe. The full argument is in ADR-0006.

// deliveryProbeInterval is how often a send parked on back-pressure re-checks its
// class ceiling. It bounds resume latency under sustained back-pressure only —
// paid while a consumer is already behind, invisible behind the backlog — and in
// tests fires deterministically via the fake clock.
