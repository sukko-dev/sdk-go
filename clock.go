// This file holds the determinism seams: every wall-clock read and every random
// draw in the SDK goes through them.
//
// Go's race detector proves the SDK is free of data races, but it says nothing
// about whether a backoff schedule is correct. That needs a fake clock — and a
// fake clock only helps if the test can rendezvous with the timer it is about to
// fire. Hence the purpose name on every timer: a test waits for "backoff"
// specifically, rather than for "some number of timers", which would couple it
// to however many unrelated timers the client happened to have armed.
//
// The production implementations are the obvious ones. BlockUntilTimer is a
// no-op on them: it is a test rendezvous, and a live client must never block on
// it.

// timerPurpose names a timing path. The set is closed — an unlisted path is a
// real sleep waiting to happen, which is exactly what these seams exist to
// prevent.
