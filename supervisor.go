// The supervisor is the client-lifetime goroutine that owns the connection: it
// dials, runs the decode loop for one epoch, classifies how the epoch ended,
// backs off, and re-dials — and, on every exit path, performs the terminal
// sequence (set the terminal cause, close the transport, deliver the final
// *Terminal into its reserved slot, close Messages()). Close does NOT perform
// that sequence; it cancels the root and waits, and the supervisor's own exit
// does the teardown. That inversion is what makes "Messages() is closed by
// exactly one goroutine" literal and keeps a terminal failure (which runs with
// no Close in flight) on the same path as a clean stop.
//
// Termination classification is driven entirely from the policy tables in
// policy.go — closePolicy, handshakePolicy, and (in a later slice)
// internalCausePolicy — so a class the tables enumerate is the class the loop
// enacts, with no second copy of the rules here.

// closeCodeNormalClosure is the RFC 6455 normal-closure code the SDK sends on a
// clean local close. coder/websocket usually kills the socket first when the
// read context is canceled, so this frame often never reaches the wire; the
// pinned close ordering accepts that.
